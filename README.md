# Tensile Testing of Simulated Foot and Material Properties Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the **simulation and testing** of a **foot part** using the **PASCO Lab Tensile Testing** setup. The aim is to analyze material properties through data analysis and improve the design using **SolidWorks**. The analysis was performed using **Python** (NumPy, Matplotlib, Linear Regression) and **Minitab** (statistical tools, graphing, and linear regression) to extract the material properties. The validated properties were then used to modify the part for better performance in tensile testing.

## Steps Taken

### 1. **Simulated Foot in PASCO Lab Tensile Testing**
   - A foot part was simulated and subjected to tensile testing using the **PASCO Lab**.
   - Data collected from the tests included **displacement**, **force**, and **time**.

### 2. **Data Analysis Using Python**
   The collected data was analyzed using a **Python notebook** with the following tools:
   - **NumPy**: For data manipulation and mathematical calculations.
   - **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs to visualize the force-displacement relationship.
   - **Linear Regression**: To identify the linear region of the stress-strain curve and calculate material properties.

### 3. **Data Analysis Using Minitab**
   **Minitab** was used to analyze the data further using its powerful statistical tools:
   - **Subset Data**: Used to focus on specific regions of the data (e.g., linear stress-strain region).
   - **Statistical Graphing**: Graphs like histograms and box plots to analyze the distribution of material properties.
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated mean, standard deviation, and other metrics for key variables (e.g., force, displacement).
   - **Calculator Functionality**: Used to compute new columns (e.g., stress/strain ratio).
   - **Linear Regression**: Performed to fit a model to the stress-strain curve and extract material properties like Youngâ€™s Modulus and yield strength.

### 4. **Verification Using SolidWorks**
   - Material properties obtained from **Python** and **Minitab** were applied in **SolidWorks** for verification.
   - **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** was used to simulate and analyze the part's behavior under tensile stress, focusing on resistance in specific areas.
   - SolidWorks simulations confirmed that the material properties were valid and closely aligned with expectations.

### 5. **Modification of Simulated Foot Part**
   - Based on the analysis, the **simulated foot part** was modified in **SolidWorks**.
   - Increased **Moment of Inertia (MOI)**.
   - Incorporated an **I-beam structure** to improve resistance against tensile forces.

### 6. **3D Printing and Final Testing**
   - The modified foot part was **3D printed**.
   - The new design was tested using the **PASCO Lab Tensile Testing** setup.
   - The modified part showed improved performance under tensile testing, confirming that the design changes led to enhanced resistance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: NumPy, Matplotlib, Linear Regression.
- **Minitab**: Data Subsetting, Statistical Graphing, Descriptive Statistics, Linear Regression.
- **SolidWorks**: Material Property Analysis, 3D Modeling, Simulation, Finite Element Analysis (FEA).
- **PASCO Lab**: Tensile Testing Equipment.

## Conclusion
The combination of simulated testing, data analysis using Python and Minitab, and solid design verification in SolidWorks led to a **significant improvement** in the material's performance under tensile testing. The modified foot part exhibited **better resistance**, validating the design changes. The **FEA analysis** confirmed the improvements in resistance at critical points in the part.
